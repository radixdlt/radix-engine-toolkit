//! This internal prelude module exposes two main public modules that can be
//! imported by other modules in this crate: an [`engine`] and a [`toolkit`]
//! modules. These two modules are meant to be preludes for the engine stack
//! and toolkit respectively. This is meant to replace the old system we had
//! where we would import everything by name and then add a prefix to it, which
//! quickly turned out to be very hard to manage. Instead, once this module is
//! imported typed such as [`engine::NetworkDefinition`] become available.
