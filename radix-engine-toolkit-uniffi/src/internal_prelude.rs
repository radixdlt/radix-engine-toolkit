//! This is an internal prelude module meant to only be public within this crate which re-exports

//! distinguish between the core toolkit types, scrypto types, and types defined in this crate.
//! We choose the types in this crate to have short un-prefixed names since those are the names that
//! the types will be generated with when using UniFFI
